## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

It's my first challange on Frontend Mentor and wanted to try Flexbox to make this responsive card layout. I learned how to make image files fully responsive, and found out how easy to resahape the layout with Flexbox.

### Continued development

I will master Flexbox with all the features it provides. I still have to do a lot more with media queries. I will definitely try mobile-first approach sometime .
